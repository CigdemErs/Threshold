# Threshold

This project involves applying thresholding techniques to a dataset of fingerprint images to enhance their visibility for further analysis. The dataset includes real and altered fingerprint images. Google Colab is used for the project. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing

Threshold is applied only ALtered-Easy and Real fingerprints. The same code part that is used for Altered-Easy also can be used for Altered-Medium and Altered-Hard. New images (after thresholding) are saved to another folders with their respected label.
